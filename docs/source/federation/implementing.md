title: Implementing a federated graph
description: Putting the pieces together
---

An Apollo Federation architecture consists of:

* A collection of **implementing services** that each define a distinct GraphQL schema
* A **gateway** that composes the distinct schemas into a **federated data graph** and executes queries across that graph

To be part of a federated graph, an implementing service must conform to the Apollo Federation specification, which exposes the service's capabilities to the gateway,
as well as to tools like Apollo Graph Manager. A service can **extend** GraphQL types that are defined by _other_ services, and it can define types for other services to extend.

Let's look at how to get a federated graph up and running. We'll start by preparing an existing implementing service for federation, and then we'll set up a gateway in front of it.

## Defining a federated service

Converting an existing schema into a federated service is the first step in building a federated graph. To do this, we'll use the `buildFederatedSchema()` function from the `@apollo/federation` package.

To start, here's a *non-federated* instance of Apollo Server:

```javascript:title=index.js
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server');

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    me: User
  }

  type User {
    id: ID!
    username: String
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    me() {
      return { id: "1", username: "@ava" }
    }
  }
};

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
});

server.listen(4001).then(({ url }) => {
    console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`);
});
```

This should look familiar if you've [set up Apollo Server](/getting-started/) before. If it doesn't, we recommend you familiarize yourself with the basics before jumping into federation.

Now, let's convert this to a federated service. The first step is to install the `@apollo/federation` package in our project:

```bash
npm install @apollo/federation
```

In our federated server definition, we want _other_ services to be able to extend the
`User` type we define. To enable this, we add the `@key` directive to the
`User` type's definition to make it an **entity**:

```js:title=index.js
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server');
const { buildFederatedSchema } = require('@apollo/federation');

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    me: User
  }

  type User @key(fields: "id") {
    id: ID!
    username: String
  }
`;
```

The `@key` directive tells other services which fields to use to uniquely identify
instances of `User`. In this case, those services should use the `id` field.

Next, we add a **reference resolver** for the `User` type. A reference resolver tells the gateway how to fetch an entity by its `@key` fields:

```js:title=index.js
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    me() {
      return { id: "1", username: "@ava" }
    }
  },
  User: {
    __resolveReference(user, { fetchUserById }){
      return fetchUserById(user.id)
    }
  }
};
```

Finally, we use the `buildFederatedSchema` function to augment our schema definition
with federation support. We provide the result of this function to the
`ApolloServer` constructor:

```js:title=index.js
const server = new ApolloServer({
  schema: buildFederatedSchema([{ typeDefs, resolvers }])
});

server.listen(4001).then(({ url }) => {
    console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`);
});
```

The server is now ready to be added to a federated data graph!

Here's the complete code sample for our federation-ready server:

```js:title=index.js
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server');
const { buildFederatedSchema } = require('@apollo/federation');

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    me: User
  }

  type User @key(fields: "id") {
    id: ID!
    username: String
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    me() {
      return { id: "1", username: "@ava" }
    }
  },
  User: {
    __resolveReference(user, { fetchUserById }){
      return fetchUserById(user.id)
    }
  }
}

const server = new ApolloServer({
  schema: buildFederatedSchema([{ typeDefs, resolvers }])
});

server.listen(4001).then(({ url }) => {
    console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`);
});
```

## Running a gateway

Now that we have a federation-ready service, we can build our gateway as a separate
service. First, let's install Apollo Server and the `@apollo/gateway` package:

```bash
npm install apollo-server @apollo/gateway graphql
```

Now we can create a new service that acts as a gateway to our underlying
implementing services:

```js
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server');
const { ApolloGateway } = require("@apollo/gateway");

// Initialize an ApolloGateway instance and pass it an array of implementing
// service names and URLs
const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
  serviceList: [
    { name: 'accounts', url: 'http://localhost:4001' },
    // more services
  ],
});

// Pass the ApolloGateway to the ApolloServer constructor
const server = new ApolloServer({
  gateway,

  // Disable subscriptions (not currently supported with ApolloGateway)
  subscriptions: false,
});

server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`);
});
```

In the above example, we provide the `serviceList` configuration option to the
`ApolloGateway` constructor. This array specifies a `name` and `url` for each
of our implementing services. You can specify any string value for `name`, which
is used primarily for query planner output, error messages, and logging.

On startup, the gateway fetches each implementing service's capabilities and composes
a federated data graph. It accepts incoming requests and creates query plans that query the graph's implementing services.

> If there are any composition errors, the `new ApolloServer` call throws an exception
> with a list of [validation errors](/federation/errors/).

### Securing implementing services

Due the power and flexibility of federation's `_entities` field, **only the gateway should be accessible by GraphQL clients**. Individual implementing services
should **not** be accessible. Make sure to implement firewall rules, access control
lists, or other measures to ensure that individual implementing services can
be accessed only via the gateway.

> In production, we recommend configuring the gateway in a managed mode, which relies on static files rather than introspection. For details on how to use the [Apollo schema registry](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/platform/schema-registry/) to support this workflow, see [the platform docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/platform/federation/).

## Sharing context across services

### Customizing incoming requests

If you have an existing set of services, you've probably already
implemented some form of authentication to associate each request with a user, or
you require that some information be passed to each service via request headers. The `@apollo/gateway` package makes it easy to reuse Apollo Server's context feature to customize which information is sent to implementing services.

The following example demonstrates passing user information from the gateway
to each implementing service via the `user-id` HTTP header:

```javascript{9-18,23-32}
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server');
const { ApolloGateway, RemoteGraphQLDataSource } = require('@apollo/gateway');

const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
  serviceList: [
    { name: 'products', url: 'http://localhost:4001' },
    // other services
  ],
  buildService({ name, url }) {
    return new RemoteGraphQLDataSource({
      url,
      willSendRequest({ request, context }) {
        // pass the user's id from the context to underlying services
        // as a header called `user-id`
        request.http.headers.set('user-id', context.userId);
      },
    });
  },
});

const server = new ApolloServer({
  gateway,

  // Disable subscriptions (not currently supported with ApolloGateway)
  subscriptions: false,

  context: ({ req }) => {
    // get the user token from the headers
    const token = req.headers.authorization || '';

    // try to retrieve a user with the token
    const userId = getUserId(token);

    // add the user to the context
    return { userId };
  },
});

server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`);
});
```

The `buildService` function enables us to customize the requests that are sent to our implementing services. In this example, we return a custom `RemoteGraphQLDataSource`. The datasource allows us to modify the outgoing request with information from the Apollo Server `context` before it's sent. Here, we add the `user-id` header to pass an authenticated user ID to downstream services.

### Customizing outgoing responses

Similarly, the `didReceiveResponse` callback allows us to inspect an implementing
service's `response` in order to modify the `context`. The lifecycle of a request to
a federated server involves a number of responses, multiple of which might contain
headers that should be passed back to the client.

Suppose our services all use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control" target="_blank" stop="_italicizing" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cache-Control</a> header's `max-age` value. Each service might return a different value for this header, but the gateway can respond with only one. In this case, it should respond with the minimum of all returned values. We can implement this behavior with the `didReceiveResponse` callback and an `ApolloServerPlugin`:

```javascript{4-20,48,59-71}
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server');
const { ApolloGateway, RemoteGraphQLDataSource } = require('@apollo/gateway');

class DataSourceWithCacheControl extends RemoteGraphQLDataSource {
  async didReceiveResponse(response, request, context) {
    const body = await super.didReceiveResponse(response, request, context);
    // Parse the Cache-Control header and update the value on context if it's
    // _less_ than the current value (or if no value is currently set).
    const cacheControl = response.headers.get('Cache-Control');
    if (cacheControl) {
      const result = cacheControl.match(/max-age=(\d*)/);
      if (Array.isArray(result) && result[1]) {
        context.cacheControl.maxAge = context.cacheControl.maxAge
          ? Math.min(context.cacheControl.maxAge, Number(result[1]))
          : Number(result[1]);
      }
    }
    return body;
  }
}

const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
  serviceList: [
    { name: 'products', url: 'http://localhost:4001' }
    // other services
  ],
  buildService({ url }) {
    return new DataSourceWithCacheControl({ url });
  }
});

const server = new ApolloServer({
  gateway,
  subscriptions: false, // Must be disabled with the gateway; see above.
  context() {
    return { cacheControl: { maxAge: null } };
  },
  plugins: [
    {
      requestDidStart() {
        return {
          willSendResponse({ context, response }) {
            // Append our final result to the outgoing response headers
            response.http.headers.append(
              'Cache-Control',
              `max-age=${context.cacheControl.maxAge}`
            );
          }
        };
      }
    }
  ]
});

server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`);
});
```
